## Description

This project is a collection of various algorithms and data structures implemented in C. Here's a brief summary of the code:

1. **Heap Sort**: The user is prompted to enter the number of elements in an array and then inputs the elements. The program sorts the array using the heap sort algorithm. Finally, the sorted array is printed.

2. **Binary Search**: Similar to heap sort, the user inputs the number of elements and the elements of an array. Then, the user provides a key to search for within the array and specifies the range of indices to search within. The program performs a binary search on the array and outputs whether the key is found and at what index.

3. **Stack Operations**: This part of the code implements basic stack operations such as push, pop, and peek. The user is presented with a submenu to choose these operations, and appropriate actions are taken based on the user's choice.

4. **Bubble Sort**: The user is prompted to input the number of elements and the elements of an array. The program then sorts the array using the bubble sort algorithm and prints the sorted array.

5. **Dequeue Operations**: Similar to stack operations, this section implements operations on a double-ended queue (deque). The user can insert and delete elements from both the front and rear ends of the deque, as well as display its contents.

6. **Quick Sort**: As with previous sorting algorithms, the user inputs the number of elements and the elements of an array. The program sorts the array using the quick sort algorithm and prints the sorted array.

7. **Process Scheduling**: This part focuses on a basic process scheduling algorithm. The user inputs the number of processes and their respective burst times. The program sorts the processes based on their burst times, calculates waiting times and turnaround times, and then displays them along with the process details.

The entire program is encapsulated within a loop that continues to display a menu until the user chooses to exit. Each menu option corresponds to a specific functionality, making the code modular and easy to navigate. Additionally, sleep statements are incorporated to introduce a pause between menu displays, enhancing the user experience by giving them time to read and understand the options.
